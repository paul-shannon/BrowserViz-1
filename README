RCytoscape README
-----------------
Unit tests are a crucial tool in software development.  But due to the very large 
number of methods provided by this package -- about 175 -- and that many of these
invoke time-consuming actions in a separately executing Cytoscape application,
the unit tests for this package are not run as part of the standard Bioconductor
build process.

In order to run them 'offline' however, take these steps from within a running R 
session:

  1) source(system.file("unitTests", "test_cytoscape.R", package="RCytoscape"))
  2) run.tests ()

They take about 20 minutes to run.
