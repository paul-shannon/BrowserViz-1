SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o changed method names: layout -> layoutNetwork, version -> pluginVersion, 
      get/setPosition -> get/setNodePosition

      for package developers using RCytoscape: edgemode, addNode, addEdge, 
      requested by Robert Flight.

BUG FIXES

      from ':.:' to ':-:' saveLayout now has optional 3rd parameter,
